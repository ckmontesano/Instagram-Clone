# Instagram App Clone
Thought I would take a crack at the Instagram UI to practice my SwiftUI skills.

## Sources
- The **Instagram** logo came from Instagram (obviously)
- The **images** used came from google searches and I do not own the rights to these. If you own any of these and wish for me to replace them, feel free to email me or shoot me a message.
- The **icons** used (*plus icons, hearts, bookmarks*) are provided by Apple via SF Symbols.
